Joined the library. Got Care of the Skin, Origin of 
the Species, and a book by a woman my mother is 
always going on about. It was called Pride and 
Prejudice, by a woman called Jane Austen. I could 
tell the librarian was impressed. Perhaps she was an 
intellectual like me. She didn't loop at my spot, 
so perhaps it was getting smaller. About time!

Wednesday January 14th

None of the teachers at school have noticed that I am an intellectual. They
will be sorry when I am famous. There was a new girl in our class. She sits
next to me in Geography.
She was all right. Her name was Pandora, but she likes being called "Box".
Don't ask me why. I might fall in love with her. It's time I fell in love,
after all I am 13 3/4 years old.
